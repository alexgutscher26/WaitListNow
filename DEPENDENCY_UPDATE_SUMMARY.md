## Issues Encountered

1. ESLint configuration referenced a missing 'custom' configuration
2. Tailwind CSS 4.x has breaking changes, including moving the PostCSS plugin to a separate package
3. Some dependencies had peer dependency conflicts

## Recommendations

1. Consider upgrading to Tailwind CSS 4.x in the future with proper migration
2. Add tests to the project to ensure functionality
3. Review the @heroui/theme dependency which expects Tailwind CSS 4.x
